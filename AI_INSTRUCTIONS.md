## How to Start a Conversation

1. **Clarify Context:** Ensure that the context of the project (Codex-Construct) is clear. If it's a new task or feature, explain the desired outcome.
2. **Ask for Guidance:** For development or design-related questions, ask for clarifications on any design decisions, code structures, or best practices.
3. **Discuss First, Code Later:** For new features or refactors, always discuss the approach before starting code. 
4. **Don't Assume:** Always ask for further details before making assumptions. If you're unsure about something, always clarify first.

## General Guidelines

- Keep conversations focused on design and project flow.
- Discuss the project structure, including the repo layout, tools, and conventions.
- Always refer to and update documentation before moving on to TDD.
