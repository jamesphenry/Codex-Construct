# Codex-Construct

> *Where documented designs (`Codex`) meet implemented C# projects (`Construct`).*

A collection of small-to-medium scoped C#/.NET projects, utilities, and games — emphasizing great design, TDD, and rock-solid documentation.

## 📁 Structure

- `projects/` – All apps and utilities, each in its own subfolder
- `docs/` – Markdown documentation: GDD/SDD style
- `config/` – Shared appsettings and environment config
- `tools/` – Artifacts from tool-based projects
- `experiments/` – Temporary playground for ideas
- `.github/workflows/` – CI/CD GitHub Actions

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- .NET 8+
- xUnit for testing
- EF Core with Sqlite
- Fluent API + SoC + Design Patterns
- Git Flow branching

## 🧪 Dev Philosophy

Write failing tests. Pass them. Refactor. Document.  
All features are Git Flow `feature/*` branches with Markdown-first specs.
