# Codex-Construct

**Tagline**: *Where documented designs (`Codex`) meet implemented C# projects (`Construct`).*

## Overview

`Codex-Construct` is a collection of small-to-medium scoped C#/.NET projects, utilities, and games, with a strong emphasis on **great design**, **test-driven development (TDD)**, and **rock-solid documentation**. This repository serves as a playground for clean, structured development, leveraging best practices in C# design patterns, separation of concerns, and modern .NET workflows.

## Purpose

This repo aims to document and implement C# projects with clear architecture, using **unit tests** and **Fluent API** design. Each project focuses on solving a specific problem or demonstrating a key design principle in C#/.NET.

## Features

- TDD-first development with xUnit
- Fluent API and clean architecture
- Continuous integration support (each project may have its own configuration)
- Detailed, GDD/SDD-style project documentation
